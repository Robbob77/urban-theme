I grew up in the Northern California Bay Area and am a newly resident New Englander hanging out in Vermont at the moment. Doing my best to spread conservation values while photographing and enjoying nature.
This website features expeditions of mine and includes pictures of the journey. 
My goal is to become a more experienced herper. A better understanding of optimal snake conditions, will increase encounters and allow more instances to improve my photography.
Ultimately, this website will serve as a tool to document my outings and accumulate my photography.

I am currently using a Cannon EOS 90D Body with three lenses. A Canon EF-S 19-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II, Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III, and a Tamron SP 90mm f/2.8 Di VC USD.
