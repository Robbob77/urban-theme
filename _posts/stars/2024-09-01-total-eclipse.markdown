On August 21, 2017 my family heard about the total eclipse passing across the contiguous states and were fortunate enough to get in the path. We made it to Madras, Oregon where we were among the first in the USA to be put in the shadow. Totality lasted 2 minutes and 1 second. It was incredible and we immediately put April 8, 2024 on the calendar.

Totality was passing through the north part of Vermont and we did our research to find a place to watch that wouldn't become overwhelmed by the influx of watchers. Enosburg Falls was the final location. Set up on the edge of a farm field, I was prepared to capture the eclipse on camera. Once we saw that partial totality had begun, I set up my camera on a tripod to timelapse the event. On an interval, I captured the progress from the start of partial to the end of totality. Brought into the same frame, here is my artistic rendition of the day.

Totality lasted 3 minutes and 32 seconds bringing my time in totality to 5 minutes and 33 seconds.

Bonus shot from the fourth of July.
