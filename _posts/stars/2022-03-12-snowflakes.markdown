In 1885 Wilson Bentley, a Vermont native, is thought to be the first person to photograph snowflakes. Bentley inspired me to explore the microscopic art that are snowflakes. Below are some of my favorite photos thus far, as well as just some cool geometric shapes.

Upgraded camera to EOS 90D, focus stacked a couple, and showed a gradient of geometry.
