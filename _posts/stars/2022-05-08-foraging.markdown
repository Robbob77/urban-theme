This past fall I got into foraging for mushrooms. It started with lions mane which isn't exactly what I found. There are a few hericium species in the area and I would guess that what I find most often is bears head tooth but I have seen a coupe different forms of clusters and teeth.

In addition, I have gotten quite lucky with coming across some chicken of the woods. Particularly enjoy this.

Even came across some hen!

In the early spring I came across some wild onions (ramps?) growing around my house.

The greatest single day of foraging I have thus far had used up all my beginner luck for the year. I have stumbled upon my very first morels!!

Can't believe I was able to pick them out from above. Here is the bird's eye view.

Hopefully not the last!
