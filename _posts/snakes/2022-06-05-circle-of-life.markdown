Came across an easter gartersnake around 11am which had just nabbed a green frog by the foot. What follows is my documentation of a 3 hour struggle.

At first, the gartersnake had a hold of a single leg. But it wanted more. It was quite a battle to get the second leg. After many attempts and quite a few kicks free (not of both legs), the garter grappled the other leg into its control.

Which was the first moment where it showed off its unhinged jaw.

Time lapse of the next few minutes

After so much back and forth it was surprising to see how quickly the snake gained the upperhand. The frog hadn't given up yet. Notice in the next two photos how the frog was blowing itself up to appear too big to eat.

Though not big enough apparently.

Notice how the snake is bunching up a little. It seemed like that was one method it used to gain ground on the frog. It was slinking up the frog to get more into its stomach. This occassionally backfired and resulted in lost ground.

Cool moment to stop and appreciate the stretched out gartersnake. You can clearly see the keeled scales and the blue checker pattern on its side.

First issue was getting a hold of the frog, then both legs, slight slowing of progress to deal with the puffed up stomach, and now the next challenge is the front legs.

Quick pause to point out another frog no more than a foot in front of this action, hanging out in the stream. Lots of food around.

Second method of the garter to gain ground, inching its jaw forward. Also note the frogs clear eyelid closed.

Surprised this garter could choke the whole thing down. Got the head in and pushed the front legs up to get them in last.

Required a couple moments to open its mouth and push the frog a little bit further down and into its stomach. Then off with a happy little frog bolus in its belly.

More commentary to come later with some science about the natural history event witnessed.
