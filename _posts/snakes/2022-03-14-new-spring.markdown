Its nearing spring time! I can only say that because I'm in New England this year. Back in California we would be well into spring at this point. Here, there is snow on the ground and I was celebrating temperatures in the 40s today.

With less warmth in the year I need to be smarter about what I am doing and where, otherwise fall will be here and I won't have seen everything I want to. That being said I was scouting some brooks today getting a lay of the land for stream salamanders. Didn't expect to see anything today so I was ecstatic to see some movement in the water.

A juvenile salamander! Always fun to see. I love to see their external gills and flat tails which propel them more efficiently in water. The hard part was trying to differentiate them from Northern Dusky juveniles.

I concluded that they are two-lined salamanders as duskies have larger hind legs and juveniles are supposed to have a white mark between their eye and mouth.

All five seen today have slight variations in dots/patterns and coloration on their back.
