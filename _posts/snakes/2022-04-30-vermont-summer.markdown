Settling back into my routine, I've finally had the opportunity to go out and see some vermont herps. Thankfully, the warmth is starting to return to the Green Mountain State. Was able to come across a lot that I haven't seen in a while: Eastern Ratsnakes, Eastern Milksnakes, Northern Watersnakes, and Eastern Gartersnakes. Great day in Vermont! Here are a couple of my favorite photos from the day.

Got out again! Came across some more ratsnakes, a DOR northern watersnake, and so many garters. Ratsnakes seem to be doing quite well in the state even though they're threatened.

This is what it felt like looking at these rocks. There are three garters here (at least that I've seen), can you find them all?
