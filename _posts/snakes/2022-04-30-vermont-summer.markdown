Settling back into my routine, I've finally had the opportunity to go out and see some vermont herps. Thankfully, the warmth is starting to return to the Green Mountain State. Was able to come across a lot that I haven't seen in a while: Eastern Ratsnakes, Eastern Milksnakes, Northern Watersnakes, and Eastern Gartersnakes. Great day in Vermont! Here are a couple of my favorite photos from the day.

Got out again! Came across some more ratsnakes, a DOR northern watersnake, and so many garters. Ratsnakes seem to be doing quite well in the state even though they're threatened.

This is what it felt like looking at these rocks. There are three garters here (at least that I've seen), can you find them all?

Found my first turtle crossing the road! A very pretty painted turtle. The red color on these guys are stunning! Next encounter, I will take a little more time to appreciate it.

Huge day, saw stream salamanders (dusky, spring, two-lined), red backs, eastern newts, american toads, wood frogs, spring peepers, green frogs, and garter snakes. We saw some american toad eggs which were in amplexus, their eggs in a string shape (weird), and spotted salamander eggs. Also some wood frog tadpoles.

First spring salamanders I've ever found, super exciting. Not great photos but better to come hopefully.

I was itching to get back out and take some better photos of those spring salamanders. Took the first excuse to get back there. Wasn't long before I turned one up.

Nice sized fellow, these are such amazing creatures. Can't believe they inhabit small streams. I would never have guessed that just a couple years ago.

Love the pores on their face and the white dots under the mouth.

Happened upon a second! This one was larger and brighter. Even decided to strike a pose.

Like a tree aquatic salamander they have an incredibly flat tail which aids their underwater locomotion.

Saw some frog and toad eggs on the way out. As well as this little guy. Always a welcome sight.

Stumbled my way into some in cover, the conditions were perfect but I was still surprised to see some activity. Some garters and this surpise flip.

Four garters and a milksnake. Interesting how the garter and milksnake were, in a sense, cuddling. Have to conserve heat somehow.

Glad to see some milks, need to search out some more.

One of my favorite things about being on the east coast. Turtles!

Especially crossing the road. Which isn't necessarily a good thing, but increases the occurences. I found this large snapping turtle driving through a swamp on my way to work. Only my second ever snapping turtle seen on land. Looked like it may have been preparing a nest so I left it alone. Think I saw another turtle around the same area a couple days later but couldn't stop for it.

I've been following a small population of green frogs living in a stream by my house. There are also a handful of garter snakes living around my property and I knew the two interacted but was never exactly sure to what degree. This deserves a post by itself and you'll see that back at the home page. Here's a little teaser though.

Flipped a smooth green.
