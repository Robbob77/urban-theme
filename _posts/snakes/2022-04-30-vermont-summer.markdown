<div align="center"><h3>April 30</h3></div>

Settling back into my routine, I've finally had the opportunity to go out and see some vermont herps. Thankfully, the warmth is starting to return to the Green Mountain State. Was able to come across a lot that I haven't seen in a while: Eastern Ratsnakes, Eastern Milksnakes, Northern Watersnakes, and Eastern Gartersnakes. Great day in Vermont! Here are a couple of my favorite photos from the day.
