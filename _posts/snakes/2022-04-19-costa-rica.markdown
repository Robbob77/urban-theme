<div align="center"><h3>April 10 -- Day 1 in Costa Rica</h3></div>

As a culmination of 36 hours of travel, it was exciting to hear that the plane was beginning its descent towards San Jose. We broke through the clouds and my first impression was a bit underwhelming. From elevation I saw rolling hills of green. At eye level I was able to discern the trees touching the clouds which spanned from Nicoya to the Osa Peninsula. We landed in the gray valley of San Jose. Surprised to see the cargo DHL plane was still at the end of the runway when we landed. 

It was a short stay in San Jose. We got our car and a meal before starting our long journey south. The first night was spent in Dominical. Nothing serious planned, but it's a short stay in Costa Rica so why not wander around and herp. With no aim, we followed the road outside where we were staying which followed a river. The trunks and bushes were full of lizards, anoles, and geckos. To my surprise, shining was productive. One eye shine, some hooting and hollering, and scrambling for a ladder later I managed to capture some poorly lit photos of the first snake of the trip. Fair warning, you'll want to turn up the brightness on whatever viewing platform you're on.

The first view was of orange eyeshine above a branch. All our combined light yielded a lump on top of the branch.

We observed this snake for about an hour. It was fun to watch it manuever through the canopy on the hunt.

Caught a glimpse of its pure black prehensile tail though don't have a good photo. Stretched out with much of its weight held by its tail.

Solid pattern shot.

Best head shot we got. Classic boa head shape.

It retreated further into the canopy reminding us that it was near midnight and our adventure was just getting started. Off to be for us.

With actual plans on the horizon, I woke up ecstatic and ready to get a start to the day despite jet and travel lag. A relaxed Costa Rican breakfast helped us get a move on before leaving Domincal and continuing our drive into the Osa Peninsula. The first stop was Drakes Bay. On the way there we came across some other staples of Costa Rican wildlife: iguanas, toucans, macaws, and our first amphibians (unidentified, pretty common theme when it came to spotting frogs). We stopped at a beach to relax for a bit and my brother wandered up a stream on the otherside of the road. He caught a glimpse of a giant parrot snake escaping up into the canopy. Sweet find even though I did not get to see it. 

As we were meandering around Drake's Bay looking for places to day hike, I was shocked to see the familiar sight of a snake stretched out across the road. With no immediate clue of its identification I was glad to have assembled a snake hook. My first snake handling of Costa Rica really got my heart pumping. I was mostly confident it wasn't venomous but wasn't going to take any chances. With snake hook in one hand and camera in the other I tried my best to get photos. Means I wasn't able to get any full body shots. I'd estimate it was about three and a half feet long.

I was initially set on this being a yellow spotted keelback but after some close looks and the aid of iNaturalist I have settled on it being a bird eating snake. It looked like it could have used a shed from the dullness and looseness of the skin. Though it may have also been suffering from some health issues. There were at least 4 ticks on it as seen by the following photo. One is prominent in the bottom left part of the photo.

It had a really pretty pattern of light bands that were fairly grey/white with specks of blue throughout and a yellow underside. Would have loved to see a freshly shed individual.

Now for the guided portion of the night! We had planned a single guided night hike and were very excited. It was well worth the money as you will soon see. We got our first taste of the rainforest on this hike. I was not focused on my photography at the time as we were paying for this experience so I wanted to be in the moment and make the most of it. That being said, I obviously still took some shots. On our way to the hiking location we drove by an anteater walking along the road. The hike began walking through some open fields shining the trees. Crossing a stream we came across two Northern Cat-Eyed Snakes. The quickness of these finds made me wonder if they were staged. I was not ready for how productive we would be that night. A later stream in the middle of a field yielded metamorphosizing frogs and some young speckled caiman that our guides attempted to catch to give us a closer look. Then came our third snake of the expedition, a cloudy snail eating snake. They are really something in that region. The light pink bands contrast the black body spectacularly.

We woke up the next morning to some guests occupying our airBnB.

We had some airBnB troubles and were exhausted at this point in the trip so we had a more relaxing final few days that did not yield any more herps. It was a great trip and I can't wait till my next international adventure.
