<div align="center"><h3> June 5</h3></div>

Spending some time in NJ and the first day was a great one! Immediately the morning was successful with a flipped juvenile racer which was confirmation that it wasn't too hot yet. At the next cover we flipped a massive Coastal Plains Milksnake.

It had some great yellow bands which didn't come out too well on camera. It was refreshing to see this, especially so early in the day with it being the target of the day. This is another example of me being unaware of the difficulties with finding snakes in specific regions. In this particular county milksnakes are incredibly uncommon yet that was my second flip on the first day I was there.

While that was found in the morning, we spent the rest of the day flipping while the weather permitted it. Not much was found aside from some Red Bellied Snakes or as my company called them, milksnake food.

As we drove around we also came across a few racers. Surprisingly two of them were flipped. One large one was remarked to be a milksnake eater.

After the heat of the day we cruised as the sun descended. Saw only a couple of northern watersnakes.

As situations change in my life, my opportunities to look for stuff has really been on the rise recently. This trend will only increase and I will be updating this more and more frequently. 

I am spending some time in the NorthEast and have been looking to knock some lifers off my list. This started with a focus on copperheads which I had surprisingly not yet seen. It didn't take too long to find some hidden away up some cracks back in a shelf. Unfortunately couldn't get a photo of them. On the way back down I flipped the next one, a northern ring-neck. Not quite as special but always fun to add to the list.

The next spot yielded some northern watersnakes (apparently also a lifer) and eastern garters but no pictures were taken. Then we hiked up a mountain where we came across some special occurances. First, a beautiful spotted turtle far away from any known water sources. Rare in this region, I was surprised to see it nesting when hiking past it on the way out.

Before turning around, we came across a real shocker. Racers are rare in this region but that wasn't the only surprise. It is rather unfortunate timing that the racer was laying eggs when we flipped it. It was returned to its cover with all eggs still intact.

<div align="center"><h3> June 11</h3></div>

I had high hopes for today and while they didn't quite pan out we saw a lot of great stuff. The day started with a search for smooth greens which was unsuccessful but turned up many garters and red bellied snakes. There are lots of pretty red bellied snakes in the area with cinnamon phases, dark phases, and a cool hybrid with a brown stripe down the back. A switch to another green snake location was also unsuccessful but added some more northern ring-necks to the daily tallies. The height of the day came around noon when our focus turned to hognoses. We were greeted early on in our hike by a beauty.

Really unfortunate it was in shed. Once we poured some water on it and cleaned up the poop it smeared across its body we saw the vibrant red in the hood and the orange that went down its body.

After the excitement wore off, we continued along our way. Flipping here and there and much to my suprise found a wood turtle and a basking racer. On the way back we experienced pockets of showers which left us quite dejected but that wasn't for long. This in-situ hog brightened our spirits up quite quickly.

It is amazing watching these snakes and trying to avoid their instinct to play dead. Really detracts from our ability to take photos. This one was still quick to hood up and gape it's mouth at us.

Unfortunately this is the best shot I got of it without it's hood up. Not great but the head isn't nearly as flat as the other photos.

Cool shot of the colors on the hood. These guys puff up by sucking in air while making a funny hissing noise. They also tend to slither while presenting their hood at what they perceive to be a threat in an attempt to appear larger.

Finally, the money shot. Coiled up nice and pretty.
