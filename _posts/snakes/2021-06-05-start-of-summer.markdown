<div align="center"><h3> June 5</h3></div>

Spending some time in NJ and the first day was a great one! Immediately the morning was successful with a flipped juvenile racer which was confirmation that it wasn't too hot yet. At the next cover we flipped a massive Coastal Plains Milksnake.

It had some great yellow bands which didn't come out too well on camera. It was refreshing to see this, especially so early in the day with it being the target of the day. This is another example of me being unaware of the difficulties with finding snakes in specific regions. In this particular county milksnakes are incredibly uncommon yet that was my second flip on the first day I was there.

While that was found in the morning, we spent the rest of the day flipping while the weather permitted it. Not much was found aside from some Red Bellied Snakes or as my company called them, milksnake food.

As we drove around we also came across a few racers. Surprisingly two of them were flipped. One large one was remarked to be a milksnake eater.

After the heat of the day we cruised as the sun descended. Saw only a couple of northern watersnakes.
