Suriname is a small country on the northern part of South America. As one of the Guayanas, there is a history of colonial influence. The Dutch granted indpendence to Suriname in 1975. Dutch remains one of the primary languages spoken in the country. Sranan Tongo, an english-based creole language, would be the second most prominent language.

One of their allures is being the country with the highest proportion of forest cover in the world. Believed to be 90%, the tropical rainforest covers almost all of the country. Working with a local ecotourism guide, there was promise of adventures through uninhabitated rainforest to find tropical herps.

The first day starts early in the Miami airport. The previous night required traveling from Vermont to Newark, New Jersey before boarding a red-eye to Miami where we attempted to get any sleep we could. A mini shower in the airport sink to help wake up gets us from Miami to Panama City before landing in Paramaribo, Suriname.

From the airplane it is hard to argue with the claim of Suriname being the most forested country. All we could see for most of the journey was the occasional brown river snaking through the green canopy towards the Atlantic Ocean which melted into the sky. As we began to descend we flew through our first tropical rainstorm. On the other side a rainbow was added to the already dreamlike view. As we neared the city of Paramaribo, the occassional cleared lot broke the contiguous forest.

On the ground we were picked up by our guide Matthew Wallace of Unlock Nature. Immediately we head out to the Seliba River where we would be staying for the first few nights. An hour drive out of the city followed by an hour south by boat and we were putting on our boots to start looking.
